#### 1B - Executing Commands
{: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .no_toc }
When executing commands, you must take care to ensure you are doing it correctly. 

* BloxyBay's administrative system allows you to run a command by typing "/e" in front of a command. 
  * To run a command privately with the "/e" method, you need to first open up the chat to run a command like you usually would. Before running the command, however, you need to type "/e."
    * EX:  **_/e :m Hello!_**
  * This will make the command private, and this hidden from the chat. 
* You may also use the console to carry out a command. 
  * To use the console, you need to first press ";" or "'" on your keyboard. This will cause a GUI to appear at the top of your screen. When using the console, the prefix is **not** required. 
    * EX: ; (Console Opens) 
      
      **_exploit logs_**

      ( Exploit logs GUI is then shown as expected) 
   

### Acceptable Usage
{: .text-red-300 }
This is the main section of the document. It will outline everything that you can and not do with your commands. 

All major admin abuse (running ;pban all etc.) is **logged** and will result in an instant punishment! The command will be immediately canceled, and developers are notified. 

#### 4A - All commands Usage

**Arguments** = What you need to supply to run the command. 

**Allowed** = What you may use this command for. 

**Not Allowed** = What you may not use this command for.
